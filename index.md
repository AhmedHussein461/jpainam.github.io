## Biography

Hi! I am currently a **second-year Ph.D. student**, Department of Computer Science at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YevGUDgAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Qin Ke</a>. I received my Master’s degree from Babcock University in 2014, under the supervision of Prof. Okolie S.O and my bachelor’s degree in <a href="https//:www.uacosendai-edu.net" target="_blank">Cosendai Adventist University</a> in 2012.

My current research topics include object detection in images and videos, person re-identification and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
Details can be found in my <a target="_blank" href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!Avwfb9nLRWEykmJ0tpu7NWUCU9u_">CV</a>. Feel free to contact me at jpainam at gmail dot com or visit me at my Lab: Main Building, Room A2 301, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
